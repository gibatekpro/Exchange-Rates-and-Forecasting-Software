# Project

Accurately predic.ng exchange rates is very important for 
businesses, investors and decision makers as the foreign 
exchange market is very fluid and one of the most complicated 
financial marketplaces. This project aims to develop financial 
forecas.ng so@ware that is built with Java and makes use of
advanced analy.cs to predict exchange rate trends. 
#
There are various currency forecasting methods but will mainly 
be dealing with financial forecas.ng so@ware. The accuracy of 
this method depends on the complex nature of the approach used.
#
The software is built using React Framework which uses 
Typescript Programming language and the scrip.ng language, HTML. 
It is also built with Swi@UI to run on iOS opera.ng system which 
is Apple iPhoneâ€™s opera.ng system. My backend service is built 
using Spring boot, a Java-based framework and MySQL as the 
database management system, providing RESTful APIs that will be
consumed by the iOS applica.on and frontend web applica.on. 
Software will be deployed using Amazon Web Service (AWS) with a 
domain purchased on Namecheap hos.ng service. This ensures 
it is available to the public.
